# AmusementParkProject
In Terminal (I use VS Code personally): 

Database
If your database is named anything other than AMUSEMENT_PARK,
rename the db variable in the App file mysqlconnect method to that file name.
Also change the passoword to your own lol

Launching the Site

To run, start the virtual environment with -> '. env/bin/activate' 
Make a new env if necessary 
Install dependencies with the command -> 'python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt'
Activate flask with export -> 'FLASK_APP=main.py'
Run Flask to launch the website with -> 'flask run' 
Click on the link or copy paste the provided URL 

Getting Database Queries to the Website

Use the mysqlconnectmethod in App to query the database
Use the output in the routing functions with said output 
(the Vendors method does this if you need an example )
